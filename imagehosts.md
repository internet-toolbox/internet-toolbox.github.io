- Some images are zoomed out to capture the whole page.
- Not listed in any order.
- Please keep in mind that quality of some "reviews" might not be as good as others because I've been demotivated for the past few weeks.
- When referring to "UI", I'm mainly talking about the dashboard of the host.
- The UI is rated based on my preference, which is the main reason for an image of the hosts dashboard, so you can decide by yourself.
- Might do pros and cons of each host
- Public hosts won't have as much info as other hosts since... they're public
- "Invisible urls aren't supported", if invisible urls aren't supported, 
- Upload speeds??? - read [FAQ](faq.md)

    - ```
      When enabled, Horizon efficiently creates an identifiable representation of file data. If Horizon detects a duplicate file, it can return the previously uploaded file instead, minimizing upload processing time and reducing server load.
      ```
  
  - Security and Privacy
    
    - 2FA
    - Discord as a sign in method
    - Self destruct for uploads after a given time period has ended (1d - 2w)

  - Security
    
    - 2FA
    
    - IP checking for uploads

- Many more features I might have missed. I didn't try to review this as in depth as others because it's public. You can register yourself an account and check the host out.

- There is a "free" option however there are some limitations,
  - uploads are limited to 100 per day
  - Autowipe and exploding files are locked
- Will be updated to have bio pages so will be updated soon when that happens!
- Owner (pringles) is a backend dev, and he's the only person working on the project, hopefully a new frontend will come sooner or later.

## [Tiny](https://tiny.rip)

- A *tiny* public, free to use image host.

- You have to join their discord and make a ticket to claim an account.

- UI intentionally looks very similar to the discord ui, not my style but it's easy to figure out especially if you spend 24/7 on discord - 4/10

- Has really good domains after cynical donated them when lean shutdown (rip)
- The 768MB storage limit is pretty restrictive (and pretty specific for some reason), specially if you're uploading high-res screenshots, though you can get more storage space by subscribing to their... subscriptions
- You can have a bio page as well!

## [encrypting.host](https://encrypting.host)

- A public (!!!) image host developed by Ralf and Sarah, owned by Ralf.

- Encrypts all of your uploads with AES-256-CBC (*a fair bit of image hosts do this, but they only encrypt images when they are written on disk. this means that the owners of the host are able to view your files, unlike on encrypting.host)

- UI looks and settings are.. acceptable... - 5/10
  
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://rape.wtf/e/HhBFW79RHy.png?key=ol1lDvWO2fs8YX&color=b026ff&title=Uploaded%20by%20K4TBO1#8106)

- Invisible urls aren't possible because of the encryption.

## [Couch](https://uploader.one) [WIP]

- Couch is a new image host developed by CoronaCarrot, Nick, カヴァ, Tim, and Neon, owned by CoronaCarrot. It is still in beta (more like alpha) so expect more to come!
- The UI doesn't look awful and doesn't burn your eyes, but it handles a bit clunky and the animations are a tad bit weird.
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://doxbin.site/‍‍​​‍​​​‍​​‍​​‍‍‍‍​‍‍‍‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍‍​‍​‍​​)
  - [Also this big fat ball on the sidebar is used to toggle the sidebar](https://doxbin.site/‍‍​‍‍‍​‍‍​​)
  - [How it looks without the sidebar](https://doxbin.site/‍‍​​​​​‍‍​‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍‍‍​​‍‍‍​​​​​‍‍​‍‍​‍)
- There is a storage limit of 1GB, which is limiting if you upload high-res screenshots.

## [Cheems](https://cheems.dog )

- Cheems is a re-release of an old host (cheems.dog -> imgs.today -> cheems.dog).
- The UI is clean and minimal - 7/10
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://cheems.dog/gCPdZf58.png)
  - [HMMM](https://i.celeste.photos/L1IGreev.gif) (yes it's on celeste fight me)
- Their 500mb upload limit is really restrictive if you upload high-res images.
- You have to login using your **upload key**, so basically unless you use a password manager you can't login through new devices.
- Invisible urls etc. aren't available...

---

## [Barius](https://barius.host)

- Barius is a re-release of an old relatively known image host, owned by barius, developed by barius and kroks It started out on 2022/06 and an invite isn't hard to come by if you are in their [discord](https://discord.gg/FwYHexrNCX).

- UI is simple and reminds me of nest.rip - 6/10
  
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://you.lgbt/%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D%E2%80%8D) (Don't open tickets for password resets just spam kroks and/or barius ;) [also spam nahsahh just in case])

## [Tixte](https://tixte.com)

- Tixte is a well known image host and it's the "most professional" host (in my opinion of course). It's public so anyone can register at any time and start using the service.
- Even though it's an image hosting service, it feels more like a cloud storage provider, specially when you take a look at their "Turbo" plans.
- UI reminds me of any cloud storage provider known to man kind.
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://neil-armstrong.is-from.space/vivaldi_ew6ZmE9fjP.png)
  - Let's you add custom CSS to your "image landing page", so it's comparatively the most customizable image landing page.
- Free users get **15GB** of cloud storage, but if you want more than that, their free plans are extremely cheap. [Take a look](https://neil-armstrong.is-from.space/vivaldi_1jDtpIoxBw.png) 

---

## [Celeste](https://celeste.photos)

- Celeste is a relatively unknown image host in the community, owned and developed by Front.

- UI looks clean *before* the recent(probably recent idk) update, which introduced *a lot* of round corners.
  
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://i.celeste.photos/iWuaSpui.png)
  
  - [Yes it's very round](https://i.celeste.photos/2G3mmeNJ.gif)

- They also have dedicated apps for Windows and Linux (OS X coming soon...)

- Image links aren't customizable so invisible urls aren't possible.

---

## [Fileglass](https://file.glass)

- Fileglass is a relatively known public host in the community, formerly known as iodine.gg, owned and developed by noodles and wowjesus.

- The UI looks pretty above average and doesn't burn your eyes.
  
  - [An image with their hosts dashboard](https://fileglass.isgoated.com/uvhqMqazQ3)
  
  - [However the upload graph does a weird jiggle when you switch between tabs/windows](https://fileglass.isgoated.com/IT3fBRyHdC)

- Image links aren't customizable as of now.
