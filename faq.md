Questions that might get asked-

Q : Why is there no score for upload speeds!?1!1?! <br>
A : I live in Asia, and I have very bad wi-fi so I can't speak for 
    the upload speeds of most image hosts.
    Basically, it depends heavily on your internet speed

Q : Why is this written in markdown instead of html or anything that isn't markdown?<br>
A : Few reasons actually,
    - I don't want to
    - Markdown is easily formattable, editable and loads much faster (because it's literally html)

Q : Why isn't this hosted on a dedicated domain?<br>
A : Because I don't want to buy a custom domain and vps just so I can host a markdown website :skull:

Q : Inspiration?<br>
A : Wouldn't call [this](https://bin.fbi.pics/list/ehQPt) inspiration for starting the project, but I did take inspiration for the ranking system etc.
